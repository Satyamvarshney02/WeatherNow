The Weather Now project is a simple web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to get real-time weather updates for any city they enter. The structure of the web page is created using HTML, which includes an input field for the user to enter the city name, a button to trigger the weather search, and a section to display the weather results. The appearance and layout are handled using CSS, which styles the input box, button, and result area to make the interface clean and visually appealing. The core functionality is powered by JavaScript, which listens for the user’s action, makes an API call to a weather service (such as WeatherAPI.com or OpenWeatherMap), and dynamically updates the webpage with the weather information received.

When a user enters a city and clicks the "Get Weather" button, the JavaScript code constructs a request URL using the provided city name and a valid API key. It then uses the fetch() function to send a request to the weather API. If the request is successful, the response contains data like the city’s temperature, weather condition, humidity, and an icon representing the current weather, which is then displayed on the page without reloading. If the city is invalid or there’s an error in fetching data, an appropriate error message is shown. This application is strictly a frontend project as it runs entirely in the browser and does not have a backend server or database. It can be enhanced further by adding features like forecast data, location auto-detection, dark mode, or even converting it into a full-stack app using a backend like Node.js and a database like MongoDB to store search history or favorite cities.
